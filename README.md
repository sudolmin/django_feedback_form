# Django Feedback Form

This project is builts for creating and viewing feedbacks for a speific registered user.

My project contains Custom CSS with some extent of Bootstrap4 on the FrontEnd.

Crispy Forms are used for handling validation front-end
A little tat of Javascript is also there to give sort of a visual feedback to the User, fillling the form
